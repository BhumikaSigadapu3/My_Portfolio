                <h6>Full Stack WebDeveloper</h6>
                <p>
                    During my full-stack web development internship with Unified Mentor, I worked on two innovative projects that enhanced my skills in both front-end and back-end development.
                    <p>Virtual Pet Simulator:
                    I am developed an interactive web application simulating the experience of caring for a virtual pet. The project focused on creating an engaging user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and incorporated animations and transitions to make the application visually appealing. The simulator is used to track attributes like hunger, happiness, and energy, which updated in real-time based on user interactions. I implemented game logic to manage the pet's states and explored optional features like multiple pet types and day-night cycles to increase complexity.</p>
                    <p>EPLQ: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Location-Based Query for Encrypted Data: I contributed to a system aimed at enhancing privacy in location-based services. Using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase, I worked on implementing modules for both administrators and users. The project focused on designing a privacy-preserving tree index structure to optimize query latency, enabling secure spatial range queries. I followed coding standards to ensure modular, testable, and maintainable code, hosting the system with appropriate design justifications, and documenting all processes in a detailed report.This internship provided me with a comprehensive understanding of web development and a strong foundation in handling complex, real-world projects while adhering to industry standards.</p>
